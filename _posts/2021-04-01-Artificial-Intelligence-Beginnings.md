## Build a Neural Network from scratch in Python

### Description
A Neural Network is one of the most commonly used computational models to apply Artificial Intelligence to real-world problems. It consists of sets of units, called neurons, connected to each other to transmit and process signals.

Each neuron is connected to others by links. Through them, they receive information, evaluate it, and spread the outcome of that evaluation, which can be either a signal to highlight a feature or to attenuate it.

The network also has one ore more Final Neurons that will take signals from previous ones and will produce that can be a real number (for regression problems) or a set of values (for classification problems).

### Objective

This post will explain how to create a Neural Network from scratch, using just the Python language, and how to use it to examine cars and predict their mileage per gallon.

## ScalaJS simulation of the Barnes-Hut approximation to solve the N-Bodies problems

The Barnesâ€“Hut simulation (named after Josh Barnes and Piet Hut) is an approximation algorithm for performing an n-body simulation. It is notable for having order O(n log n) compared to a direct-sum algorithm which would be O(n2)

This simulation is currently in Alpha state. It is not (yet) optimized nor parallelized.
